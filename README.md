# Abstract
This is a project made in the school of computer science of geneva (CFPT - Ã‰cole d'Informatique). This project is done for a diploma. Hel is a rogue-like and hack and slash type of game. It is made with pixel art and is comparable to Diablo from Blizzard Entertainment. You are free to copy and add features to this game but you must share it if you do so.
If this project gets enough attention or receives a good grading, it'll be continued and completed.
